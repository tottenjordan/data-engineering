#### Exploring selection sort

* Your computer's memory is like a giant set of drawers
* When you want to store multiple elements, use an array or a list
* With an array, all your elements are stored right next to each other
* With a list, elements are strewn all over, and one element stores the address of the next one
* Arrays allo fast reads
* Linked lists allow fast inserts and deletes
* All elements in the array should be the same type (all ints, all doubles, etc.)
