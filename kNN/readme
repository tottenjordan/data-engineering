Exploring k-Nearest Neighbors

* kNN is used for classification and regression and involves looking at the k-nearest neighbors of a data point or data set
* Classification = categorizationinto a group
* Regression = predicting a response (like a number)
* Feature extraction means converting an item (like a fruit or a user) into a list of numbers that can be compared
* Picking good features is an important part of a successful kNN algorithm
