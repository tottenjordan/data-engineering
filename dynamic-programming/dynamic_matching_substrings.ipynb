    "#### Dynamic Programming: finding the longest substring\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this program is to implement a dynamic algorithm which finds the longest matching substraing between two strings. A functions with loops allows us to find the longest matching substring in $O(n)$. Without the looping, we would have to find all matching substrings between length 1 and the maximum length of the shortest string and pick the largest one. The two strings used here are (1) the first paragraph of Moby Dick (1,111 characters) and (2) the first paragraph of the Tell-Tale Heart (388 characters).  "
