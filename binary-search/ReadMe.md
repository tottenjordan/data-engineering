Explore Binary Search

* Binary search is a lot faster than a simple search
* O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of items you're searching through grows
* Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds
* Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm
* Algorithm times are written in Big O notation
