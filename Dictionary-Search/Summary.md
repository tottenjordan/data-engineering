Summary

* An array holding a random list of 100 names is created. Five names are searched in this unsorted array using linear search. 
* The same list of 100 names are put into a dictionary/hash table. 
* The times to search for the same five names is significantly less when a dictionary/hash table vs an array. 
* This makes sense given that linear search/simple searc takes linear time, O(n). 
* Search times in the dictionary were the same except the first search, which proves that search time in a hash tables 
takes constant time, O(1)

* The average runtime of quicksort is O(n log n) which is one of the fastest sorting algorithms. 
* After sorting the names, six names placed in 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, 90th, and 100th place were searched using linear and binary searches. 
* Runtimes of linear search increases for each name since the names are sorted alphabetically and linear seach requires additional search to go through the sorted array. 

* Binary search takes far less time than linear search since it is able to divide the list in half and reduce the runtime to O(log n) 
* However, the time to get the same names from a hash table remains to be the fastest, further proving that looking up a value in a hash table takes constant time, O(1).
