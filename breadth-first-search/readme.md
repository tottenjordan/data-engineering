The goal of this assignment is to assess the execution time of breadth-frst-search (BFS) on a connection graph. 

We develop a five level connection graph, without duplicates in each node, and search for particular names in each level of the graph. The purpose of the connection graph is to work in a similar fashion as a dictionary. From the results, we noted that connection graphs, like dictionaries, tend to have incredibly fast run times.
